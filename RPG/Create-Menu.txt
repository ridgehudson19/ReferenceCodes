Create a menu
1. STRSDA - option 2 (Design Menus)
2. Choose Library/source file, and menu name
3. Work with menu image and commands = Y, then ENTER
4. Edit screen like a normal DDS screen
5. Put asterick on 'selection or command' line to change DDS settings for the command line
6. option F10 assigns program calls to menu selections
7. Exit and save by F3, F3, ENTER
8. Remove command line for user by doing CHGMNU command, then change CMDLIN to *NONE

To compile a new menu:
1. Copy the MNUDDS and MNUCMD into a library/source file
2. Put option 17 on MNUCMD or MNUDDS file
3. Exit and compile by F3, then ENTER

two types of menus:
1. display file menu (done by using STRSDA; steps above create display file menu)
2. program menu

creating a display file menu is quicker and easier but it is also limited.
display file menus are only able to use numeric-user commands. (cannot have options like A or B)
program menus allows for character-user commands and multi-page menus.
Display file menus must follow a particular format from which you cannot deviate; 
You cannot define your own function keys-these are defined for you and there's nothing you can do about them.

Program menus are created differently. You need to create two objects yourself: a display file (*FILE) and a program (*PGM). When you're done, you run the Create Menu (CRTMNU) command to create the *MENU object that ties the display file and the program together.
